                         <h3>Hello!</h3>
                        <p>Music and technology. That about sums me up. I developed my interests in both of these at a young age. While my friends were watching nineties cartoons I was using my first personal computer to learn Qbasic language. My  passion for music and sound inspired my thesis. I integrated sound and technology to create a project about  Blind Source Separation of voice signals in time-frequency domain. The thesis received highest honors by the     defense committee and thesis director.

                        <p>
                            Currently I develop stuff.
                            I started my career as a developer in the Contact Center area, helping businesses create IVR applications that make communications to customers clearer and easy to navigate.
                            Like 90% of developers, I started with back end technologies. But my passion for Front End and technologies such as AngularJS has increased in the past year - I even like UX now. 
                            I believe in a continuous learning career path. I believe it would help you achieve your goals and eventually lead you to your dream job.
